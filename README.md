## Angular Sports Catalog App

Explore a dynamic Angular application showcasing a catalog of sports products crafted using artificial intelligence. This application incorporates Angular Material and Tailwind CSS for a visually appealing and responsive design. With a fake backend powered by JSON Server, it facilitates CRUD operations seamlessly. The implementation includes the use of Reactive Forms, route guards for route protection, and efficient management of environment variables.

### Key Technologies

- **Angular Material:** Enhancing UI components and design aesthetics.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Styling framework for a modern and responsive layout.
- **JSON Server:** A fake backend providing a simulated environment for CRUD operations.
- **Reactive Forms:** Enabling a reactive and dynamic form management system.
- **Route Guards:** Ensuring secure navigation through protected routes.
- **Environment Variables:** Efficient handling of environment-specific configurations.

### Getting Started

To run the application and set up the fake backend:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kevinShogun/angular-sport-shop.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd angular-sport-shop
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the JSON Server for the fake backend:

   ```bash
   npm run backend
   ```

5. Start the Angular application:

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

6. Access the application via your browser at `http://localhost:4200/`.

### Note

Ensure that the fake backend is running (`npm run backend`) to enable CRUD operations on the sports catalog. The JSON file and its backup can be found in the `data` folder.

### Usage

Explore the sports catalog, test the CRUD functionalities, and experience the seamless integration of Angular features and AI-generated product listings.
